# CHANGELOG

## Unreleased

- Breaking: Fee routing overhaul, overflow clamp, invariants **INV-FEE-01** and **INV-FEE-02**.
- Breaking: rename `fee_token` to `fee_selector` and bump crypto domain tag to `THE_BLOCKv2|`.
- Fix: isolate temporary chain directories for tests and enable replay attack
  prevention to reject duplicate `(sender, nonce)` pairs.
- Fix: enforce mempool capacity via atomic counter and `O(log n)` priority
  heap; timestamps stored as monotonic ticks.
- Feat: introduce minimum fee-per-byte floor with `FeeTooLow` rejection.
