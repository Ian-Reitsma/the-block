# Official Chain Policy

This policy defines what is considered an official build of The Block and how
operators, exchanges, and integrators can verify it.

## Official builds
An official build must satisfy all of the following:
- It is built from a tagged source revision in the `the-block-core` repository.
- It is signed by the maintainer release keys listed in
  `config/release_signers.txt`.
- The release artifacts are accompanied by `provenance.json` and
  `checksums.txt` generated by the release pipeline.
- The binary hash matches `env!("BUILD_BIN_HASH")` checks enforced by
  `node/src/provenance.rs`.

### Current official tag
- **Tag:** `core-0.1.1`
- **Tag object hash:** `3b459b5e29790a1b13a2d2220d577394d0a4a423`
- **Points to commit:** `97986ef27f918a7f064bc91729120e2c1addeba8`
- **Signature:** Good signature from `CoreReleaseSigner1` (fingerprint
  `C213D2E0F8BCF523C46610FE18FBDEFF67871CA0`) as verified by
  `git tag -v core-0.1.1`

## Verification steps
1. Fetch the release artifacts, `provenance.json`, and `checksums.txt`.
2. Verify the signatures against the public keys in
   `config/release_signers.txt`.
3. Confirm the artifact hashes match the values in `checksums.txt`.
4. Confirm the build hash equals the runtime `BUILD_BIN_HASH`.

## Forks and unofficial builds
- Forks are allowed under Apache 2.0 but must not claim to be official.
- Forked releases must be clearly labeled and must not use The Block branding
  without written permission. (Trademark registration in flight; enforce once
  the mark is issued.)

## Changes to this policy
Any change to release signing keys or the verification process must update this
document and `docs/security_and_privacy.md`.
