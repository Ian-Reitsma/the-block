# Telemetry Operations

This guide outlines anomaly detection and incident response for The‑Block.

* Prometheus exporter surfaces `anomaly_alarm_total` when sudden peer drops or metric spikes are detected.
* Operators can run `contract-cli telemetry tail` to stream live allocation stats for troubleshooting.
* Historical metrics may be archived by setting `TB_METRICS_ARCHIVE` to an object store path.
* Weekly summaries are generated by the metrics aggregator and uploaded alongside other reports.

Maintain SLA targets by reacting to alarms within five minutes and keeping exporter availability above 99%.
