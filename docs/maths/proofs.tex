\section{Inflation Bounds}
The inflation governor ensures epoch-by-epoch issuance follows a predefined schedule with risk-sensitive adjustments. Formal proof of convergence and Lyapunov stability is provided in Section~\ref{sec:kalman}. Additionally, a non-interactive Groth16 proof attests that the cumulative BLOCK minted to date never exceeds the bound $S_0 (1 + I_y)$.

Let $m$ be the total minted BLOCK and $B$ the cap. The circuit enforces
\begin{equation}
 m + r = B, \qquad r \ge 0
\end{equation}
where $r$ is a non-negative slack witness. Prover and verifier generate and check a Groth16 proof $(\pi)$ with public inputs $(m,B)$; verification succeeds only when $m \le B$.

Quarterly, the prover posts $(\pi, B)$ on-chain. Light clients recompute the cap from the emission schedule and verify the proof using the prepared verifying key distributed with the consensus code.
