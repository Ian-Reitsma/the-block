# The Block Trademark and Branding Policy

This document defines how the "The Block" name and brand assets may be used.
Trademark registrations are not yet filed. This policy still applies to protect
users from confusion and to preserve the integrity of official releases.

## What you may do
- Fork and modify the source code under the Apache 2.0 license.
- Describe your fork factually (e.g., "forked from the-block-core").
- Use "The Block" in nominative statements that do not imply endorsement.

## What you may not do
- Use "The Block" or confusingly similar marks to name your fork, product,
  service, or domain without written permission.
- Use The Block logos or wordmarks in a way that implies official status,
  endorsement, or affiliation.
- Claim your builds are "official" unless they are signed and published by the
  maintainers per the Official Chain Policy.

## Fork naming guidelines
- Choose a distinct name and branding for your fork.
- Avoid "The Block" in project titles, package names, binary names, or domains.
- If you need to reference The Block, do so in a clear, descriptive sentence.

## Official releases and trust
"Official" builds are defined in `docs/official_chain_policy.md`. Unsigned or
unverified artifacts are not official.

## Contact
If you want to use The Block name or logo, contact the maintainers for written
permission and brand guidelines.
