metrics:
  - name: blocktorch_kernel_variant_digest
    type: gauge
    labels:
      - digest
    description: |
      Tracks the BlockTorch kernel fingerprint (SHA256 over the variant bundle) so dashboards and CLI/governor outputs mention which kernel set powered the job.
  - name: blocktorch_benchmark_commit
    type: gauge
    labels:
      - commit
    description: |
      Emits the benchmark commit/benchmarks.json path for the last profiled job, letting operators correlate proof latency deltas with the harness output.
  - name: blocktorch_descriptor_digest
    type: gauge
    labels:
      - descriptor
    description: |
      Exposes the descriptor digest for the submitted tensor workload so auditors can verify the encoded layout that produced a given receipt.
  - name: blocktorch_output_digest
    type: gauge
    labels:
      - digest
    description: |
      Surface the deterministic inference output digest that is anchored inside receipts, proofs, and replay logs.
  - name: blocktorch_proof_latency_ms
    type: gauge
    labels: []
    description: |
      Mirrors the most recent SNARK proof verification latency (milliseconds) observed during BlockTorch job validation, matching the /wrappers proof latency panel.
  - name: blocktorch_aggregator_trace
    type: gauge
    labels:
      - hash
      - source
    description: |
      Packs the current /wrappers snapshot hash so dashboards and CLI/governor outputs can prove the telemetry bucket that produced the BlockTorch metrics.
  - name: storage_discovery_requests_total
    type: counter
    labels: []
    description: |
      Counts every storage marketplace discovery request emitted by the CLI/RPC gateway so dashboards can alert on rising DHT query volumes.
  - name: storage_discovery_results_total
    type: counter
    labels:
      - status
    description: |
      Breaks the discovery flow outcomes into `success`/`error` so the dashboards and aggregator dashboards can chart reliability.
